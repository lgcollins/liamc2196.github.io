<!--- [Nonnegative Matrix Factorization: An Empirical Analysis](https://liamc2196.github.io/files/Collinsl_Thesis.pdf)  
**Liam Collins**, advised by Prof. Yuxin Chen  
Senior thesis, Spring 2019, Princeton University  
Awarded G. David Forney Jr. Prize for excellence in Communication Science, Systems and Signals  
A comprehensive overview of traditional and recent techniques for NMF, along with thorough experimental comparison of methods and an evaluation of NMF applied to educational datasets.)
[Interpretable Gradients with Robust Training](https://liamc2196.github.io/files/cos511_adversarial.pdf)
Gene Li, **Liam Collins**, and Walter Li    
Class project for COS 511, Spring 2019, Princeton University  
We investigate the interpretable gradients phenomenon for robustly-trained CNNs and fully connected NNs, and provide theoretical explanation for interpretable gradients in a modified Bernoulli model. -->
