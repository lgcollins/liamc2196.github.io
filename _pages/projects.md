[Interpretable Gradients with Robust Training](https://liamc2196.github.io/files/cos511_adversarial.pdf)  
**Liam Collins**, Gene Li, and Walter Li
Class project for COS 511, Spring 2019, Princeton University  
We investigate the interpretable gradients phenomenon for robustly-trained CNNs and fully connected NNs, and provide theoretical justification for interpretable gradients in a modified Bernoulli model.
