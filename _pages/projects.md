[Interpretable Gradients with Robust Training](https://liamc2196.github.io/files/cos511_adversarial.pdf)  
**Liam Collins**, Gene Li, and Walter Li    
Class project for COS 511, Spring 2019, Princeton University  
We investigate the interpretable gradients phenomenon for robustly-trained CNNs and fully connected NNs, and provide theoretical justification for interpretable gradients in a modified Bernoulli model.

**Liam Collins**, advised by Prof. Yuxin Chen   
Senior thesis, Spring 2019, Princeton University  
Awarded G. David Forney Jr. Prize for excellence in Communication Science, Systems and Signals  
Comprehensive overview of traditional and recent techniques for NMF, along with thorough experimental comparison of methods and an evaluation of NMF applied to educational datasets.  

[Expository Work - Spectral Methods Meet EM: A Provably Optimal Method for Crowdsourcing](https://liamc2196.github.io/files/ele538b_proposal.pdf)  
**Liam Collins**  
Class project for ELE 538B, Fall 2018, Princeton University
