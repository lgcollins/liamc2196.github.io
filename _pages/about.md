I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin co-advised by [Prof. Aryan Mokhtari](https://sites.utexas.edu/mokhtari/) and [Prof. Sanjay Shakkottai](https://sites.google.com/view/sanjay-shakkottai/home). My research interests lie broadly in theoretical machine learning and optimization, and recently I have been studying the theoretical aspects of meta-learning.

Prior to attending UT, I completed my BSE in Electrical Engineering at Princeton University, where I was advised by [Prof. Yuxin Chen](https://www.princeton.edu/~yc5/). I also spent two of my summers working in the Advanced RF Techniques and Systems group at MIT Lincoln Laboratory as an undergrad.
