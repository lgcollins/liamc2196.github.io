**About Me**

I am a fourth-year PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin co-advised by [Aryan Mokhtari](https://sites.utexas.edu/mokhtari/) and [Sanjay Shakkottai](https://sites.google.com/view/sanjay-shakkottai/home). I am interested in the theoretical foundations of multi-task learning, particularly in federated learning and meta-learning contexts. Before UT, I did my undergraduate at Princeton University, where I worked with [Yuxin Chen](https://yuxinchen2020.github.io/).
