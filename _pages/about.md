I am a first-year PhD student in the Decision, Information and Communication Engineering (DICE) track within the ECE Department at the University of Texas at Austin. My research interests lie broadly in theoretical machine learning, as my goal is to develop and analyze more efficient techniques to harness information from data.

Prior to beginning my PhD, I completed my BSE in Electrical Engineering at Princeton University, where I was advised by Prof. Yuxin Chen. While an undergrad I spent two of my summers working in the Advanced RF Techniques and Systems group at MIT Lincoln Laboratory.
