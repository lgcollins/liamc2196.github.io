I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin co-advised by [Aryan Mokhtari](https://sites.utexas.edu/mokhtari/) and [Sanjay Shakkottai](https://sites.google.com/view/sanjay-shakkottai/home). I am interested in the theoretical foundations of multi-task learning, and have recently explored problems in federated learning and meta-learning.
