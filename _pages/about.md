I am a first-year PhD student in the Decision, Information and Communication Engineering (DICE) track within the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Texas at Austin. My research interests lie broadly in theoretical machine learning, as my goal is to develop and analyze more efficient techniques to harness information from data.

Prior to attending UT, I completed my BSE in Electrical Engineering at Princeton University, where I had the good fortune to be advised by [Prof. Yuxin Chen](https://www.princeton.edu/~yc5/). I also spent two of my summers working in the Advanced RF Techniques and Systems group at MIT Lincoln Laboratory as an undergrad.
